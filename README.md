[h1]Still A Useful Material - BETA[/h1]

This mod enables a player to make use of early strategic resources which often are no longer needed mid-late game.

[b]Features[/b]
The intention of this mod is to be able to make use of resources no longer required in later eras.

After a certain amount of iron, niter or horses has been accumulated and the Renaissance era has been reached, you will be able to use these to boost production, science and culture.

The amount of boosts are depending on the amount accumulated.
Every AI civ is also boosting once per turn with each resources, if it has 25 plus a certain threshold.
The AI needs that threshold to make sure it always has some materials laying around for using or trading it.

[b]Boostable Resources[/b]
[u]Iron[/u]
- Boost ratio: 1 Iron to 1 Production in one city on default game-speed (scales with game-speed)
- Minimal amount for boosting is 25, [b]button wont show up else[/b]
- Minimal era required: Renaissance, [b]button wont show up else[/b]
- Usable once per turn (no finishing and boosting on the same turn)
- Its a all or nothing decision, all iron will be consumed for boosting (if possible)
