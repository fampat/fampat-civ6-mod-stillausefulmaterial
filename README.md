[h1]Still A Useful Material - BETA[/h1]

This mod enables a player to make use of early strategic resources no longer needed.

[b]Features[/b]
The intention of this mod is to be able to make use of resources no longer required in later eras.

After a certain amount of iron, niter or horses has been accumulated you will be able to use these
to boost production, science and culture.

The amount of boots are only minor but steady, depending on your income of strategic resources.

[b]Boostable Resources[/b]
- Iron
Minimal amount for boosting is 25, can be used on the production-panel to boost the current
production of a city. Only usable once per turn. The entire iron will be used if possible.

If a production gets completed, only the iron for completing it will be consumed.
You need to be in the renaissance era to be able to use the iron boost.

- Horses
